          From the age of 11, we should be consuming
          <strong> no more than 30g</strong> of free sugar (
          <strong>7 cubes of sugar</strong>) per day. Lots of foods we eat
          regularly contain a suprising amount of sugar, so it is easy to go
          over the recommended allowance without realising! Excess sugar
          consumption can have a negative impact on your health in many ways, so
          we must be aware of the amount of sugar we are having every day
        </p>
